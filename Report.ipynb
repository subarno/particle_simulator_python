    "# Project Report - Particle Collider Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "The Particle Collider Simulation is a project designed to model high-energy particle collisions, similar to those performed in large-scale experiments like the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The simulation incorporates key concepts from particle physics, such as conservation of energy, momentum, and charge, as well as probabilistic transformations (Monte Carlo simulations) and fusion events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to create a realistic simulation using Python, leveraging principles of physics and computational modeling to study particle interactions and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Objectives\n",
    "The main goals of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">To simulate collisions between particles based on proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To implement conservation laws of momentum, energy, and charge.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To incorporate stochastic particle transformations using Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To model fusion events when colliding particles exceed an energy threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To visualize and analyze the behavior and properties of particles post-collision.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.1 Particle Initialization\n",
    "Attributes: Each particle is characterized by position (3D vector), velocity (3D vector), mass, charge, and type (e.g., Proton, Electron, Muon).\n",
    "Randomization: For testing, particles are initialized with random positions, velocities, masses, and charges within realistic ranges.\n",
    "##### 3.2 Collision Detection\n",
    "Proximity-Based Detection: Collisions are identified when the distance between two particles falls below a predefined threshold.\n",
    "Distance Calculation: The Euclidean distance formula is used to compute particle separations.\n",
    "##### 3.3 Collision Handling\n",
    "Momentum Conservation: The simulation ensures conservation of total momentum during elastic collisions by recalculating particle velocities.\n",
    "Energy Conservation: The total energy (rest energy + momentum energy) is conserved for each collision or transformation.\n",
    "##### 3.4 Stochastic Transformations\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation: Post-collision, particles may stochastically transform into new particles with a predefined probability.\n",
    "Transformations: Particles can split into two smaller particles with half their original mass.\n",
    "##### 3.5 Fusion Events\n",
    "Energy Threshold: If the total energy of colliding particles exceeds a predefined threshold, they fuse to form a single, heavier particle.\n",
